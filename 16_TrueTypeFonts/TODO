There are some library incompatibilites which require refinements in the

* the header includes and
* the CMakeFiles.txt.

I declare my default settings first, and then the variations for each platform.
In general, I asume the Linux/Unix varation(s) as default, simply as it's my
favorite development platform, and anything als as modification of that.

* The shared_ptr is declared at <tr1/memory>
* Required to link with SDL_ttf in demo/src/CMakeLists.txt
* SDL2_ttf is declared at <SDL2/SDL_ttf>
* Include OpenGL as <SDL2/SDL_opengl>
