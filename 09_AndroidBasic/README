This is just a the simplest SDL2 demo, using the SDL2's test/testgles.c demo and
its build-scripts/androidbuild.sh (with some modification for my project style).

At first get SDL2 and install it (e.g. into ./SDL). You may have to
modify the SDL2 path within the androidbuild.sh file.

Now you are ready to build:

# First set the Android + NDK pathes
  $ . ./setup_android.sh
# Build everything
  $ ./build.sh
# Install to you device
  $ cd com.michaelborgmann.testgles
  $ ant debug install

That's all
